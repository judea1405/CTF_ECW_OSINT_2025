My friend,

I have to keep my location secret.
Hence, I won't give you my location in clear.
Cypher algorythms could be cracked by the quantum or something 
(I fear because I do not understand fully)

I am sure you, out of everybody, will be able to understand me.

I currently live with the dog.

We have a lot to discuss in person.
Sincerely yours,
See you soon,
Larry
